## CURRENT TASK

**Task ID:** PRODUCT-ANCHOR-ADVANCE-01
**Status:** CLOSED — 2026-04-13 (post-PR#114-merge update). Product anchor advanced to `e9f285186f2cd1cc474bff93cca0249e064e4307` (merge commit for PR #114). Chain: `bc10fe3 (3D-PRINT-CLOSURE) → cf04d99 (GMAIL-READ) → 5d8f704 (AUTH-BOOTSTRAP DEC-034) → d49d3e2 (TYPECHECK-REPAIR-01) → e1093d1 (SETTINGS-CONTRACT-RETIRE-01) → 2db8ab1 (SMOKE-PROBES-RETIRE-01) → e9f2851 (merge commit) → LOCKED`. Governance ratified in parallel.
**Current queue:** EMPTY. Next bounded lane to be chosen by CTO.

**Task ID:** PR-115-E2E-FULL-GREEN-AND-ANCHOR-ROLL-01
**Status:** CLOSED — 2026-04-13. Product anchor advanced to `e95aed32ef49cea7e2b674e097cfeaec6a6ad696` (merge commit for PR #115). E2E Smoke Tests (Playwright) full green (99 passed / 0 failed). All 14 CI checks pass. Governance ratified in parallel (sync/anchor-roll-after-pr115-01).
**Current queue:** EMPTY. CTO picks next bounded lane.
**Notes:** Prior frozen queue (3D-PRINT-QUICK-VERIFY-01, GMAIL-READ-CAPABILITY-PLAN-01) RETIRED — both CLOSED. GMAIL-READ-INBOX-01/02/03 chain CLOSED / VERIFIED (see 03_STATUS.md). Product repo carries uncommitted changes across three verified lanes (3D-print closure, Gmail read implementation, E2E auth bootstrap). This task locks those changes into a new baseline product anchor.

### INSTRUCTION BLOCK

```
Bounded task: PRODUCT-ANCHOR-ADVANCE-01
Date: 2026-04-13

Scope:
1. Review the full uncommitted diff in ~/projects/akior/forge/jarvis-v5-os.
2. Commit changes in small, governance-disciplined commits — one per verified lane:
   - Lane A: 3D-print closure
   - Lane B: Gmail read implementation
   - Lane C: E2E auth bootstrap
   Do NOT create a single mega-commit.
3. Any uncommitted file that does not map to a verified lane must be either
   ratified (committed with explicit lane assignment) or reverted explicitly.
   No silent adoption.
4. After all lane commits land, record the new HEAD SHA as the product anchor
   in RESTORE_BLOCK.txt and 03_STATUS.md.
5. Do NOT add new features. Do NOT re-run verification. Verification is
   already binary-closed for all three lanes.

Out of scope:
- WhatsApp, 3D-print behavior changes, Gmail read behavior changes (all closed)
- Google credential revival
- Cloud / Light product expansion
- New external integrations

Success criteria:
- Product repo HEAD advances to a single locked SHA
- RESTORE_BLOCK.txt and 03_STATUS.md updated with the new anchor SHA
- No new product code introduced in this lock task
- Every committed file maps to a named verified lane
```

## AFTER THIS TASK
